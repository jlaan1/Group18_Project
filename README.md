# CS411 Final Project - Apartment Rental System

We have been contracted by a real estate company to construct an appropriate application for potential clients and landlords to interact with one another, with the aim of easing the process of renting properties. By reducing the number of intermediaries between the client and the landlord, service costs can be greatly reduced, leading to higher customer satisfaction and an increased number of users.

# Project Objective

  - To develop an executable, stable, and useful application

# Software

Our application will feature 7 classes as follows:
  - Main.java
  - Property.java
  - PropertyDB_Messenger.java
  - Landlord.java
  - LandlordDB_Messenger.java
  - Client.java
  - ClientDB_Messenger.java

# User Manual

1. The recommended IDE to run our application is Eclipse, and we have provided a link to the download page (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) if you do not have it already.
2. Clone this repository to Eclipse using the "Clone with HTTPS" URL under "Code" on the top right of this page.
